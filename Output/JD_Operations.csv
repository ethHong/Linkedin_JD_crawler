Role & Responsibilities
As our go-to Monk for digital strategy, you’ll play a central role in pitching for new projects and the strategic development of existing projects.Working on behalf of leading brands, you’ll help establish the strategic foundation for digital campaigns, creative content, brand sites and other award-winning projects.Expanding upon the brand’s strategy, you’ll work with the client team to develop the digital strategy, identifying what needs to be achieved and providing directions for how to achieve it.You’ll run workshops together with our clients — or whatever we’re calling meetings these days — to gather the key objectives, requirements and other success markers.Based on original research, you define the strategic scope and brief that allows our creative teams to excel, laying the groundwork on which successful projects can be built.You turn the problem into a plan by writing actionable project briefs; grounded in data and elevated by insights.Validating insights and ideas at every turn, you help to ensure the solutions we develop impact the client’s business in the best possible way, taking into account objectives as well as opportunity costs.
Requirements
For this role, we’re looking for someone with 2+ years of high-level experience developing digital strategies on behalf of high-profile brands.You’re not a brand-strategist-doing-digital but a true digital strategist who understands the online landscape through and through.You know how to analyse the full digital ecosystem using Market Research Skills like Benchmarking, a/b testing, search analysis and audience research.You understand ‘business and technology’ but talk about it in a simple way. You know how to steer big organisations through digital transformations, big or small.Your critical understanding of the digital landscape and trends enables you to ask the right questions and better-define what needs to be achieved in the first place.You can quickly grasp brands’ digital business objectives and translate them into measurable KPIs. You don’t just know where to go but also wh y, and how to get there.You’re equally capable and confident when it comes to presenting digital strategies to A-list clients, up to the C-level.You can provide solid strategic advice even under tight deadlines, tactfully narrowing the scope if need be instead of lowering the quality.You have a drive for creating clear and actionable strategy proposals and debriefs that are free of needless jargon and empty words, going beyond the obvious without slipping into the pitfall of bullshit.Your strategies are not just really good but also realistic; you have a clear understanding of what is needed to produce digital work.Last but not least, you’re a joy to work with: you’re great with clients and coworkers alike and know how to inspire teams to go the extra mile.

Cost: from $1180 USD for the first 2 weeks + $350-$430 for each week thereafter

Fee Includes: all food, accommodation, airport pickup, pre-departure + in-country support, orientation and all project related activities

Does not Include: flights, travel insurance, personal spending, visas and vaccinations

Please note: This opportunity is designed to give you the contacts and experience to help further your career. You are not replacing any member of staff, but helping alongside them, whilst learning new skills.

Start Dates: Project is on-going, and you can join at any time, depending upon availability

Benefits
 Gain personal hands-on experience working with a growing Peruvian NGO. Work alongside experienced +amp; passionate professionals and local communities. Live and work in a north Peru surfing hot-spot. Ideal for those studying NGO Management and/or looking for a career in the NGO sector. Keywords: NGO management +amp; administration, field research, sustainable development, community development, serious project. 

The Approach Towards Sustainability Consists Of Three Pillars

During this project, you will be working with a surfing-inspired sustainable development non-profit (NGO) driving the development of poor Peruvian coastal communities through a path of sustainability, improving the quality of life of their inhabitants. The NGO develops educational, infrastructure, environmental, social and economic productivity projects working hand in hand with local communities and with international volunteers/interns. They take a ""shared value"" approach, working with the private, public, academic sectors and other NGOs, to come up with relevant and lasting sustainable solutions.

 Nature conservation; Social justice; and Economic wellbeing for all.

The NGO currently operates in a coastal northern town and surfing hotspot, which has seen an increase in uncontrolled tourism over the last 15 years. As a result of the town s lack of infrastructure, lack of communication between stakeholders and lack of integrated development programmes, this tourism is giving rise to various environmental, social and economic risks to the town s long-term sustainability and wellbeing. The NGO is working to change this through a variety of projects from distinct disciplines, but needs all the help they can get. The organisation runs many different initiatives and at times finds itself thinly stretched. This is an excellent opportunity for you to gain valuable international development experience on how to run an NGO in a developing region, turning you into an agent of change, in a time when you are very much needed.

Daily Life

Ongoing day-to-day activities include but are not limited to the following initiatives/projects. Interns will be able to take part in several of these activities listed below (depending on their skills) once they have been accepted into our programme.

Tide and Swell Charts Project

This project consists of providing the fishermen of Lobitos with scientific information regarding their labour on a weekly basis, in order for them to plan ahead and optimize their productivity. Your participation in this project may include workshops with the fisherman, preparation of tide and wave size charts, research (fieldwork and data analysis) and the creation of new information tools to increase productivity. You will work together with the NGO staff and assist in the implementation of the various projects aspects.

Workshops

Once every two weeks the NGO joins the Fisherman Association for conjoined workshops where current projects and new collaboration possibilities are discussed, as well as organizational strategies for the community. These workshops require your assistance for the preparation of creative dynamics and the logistics required to implement them.

Research, Monitoring and Evaluation

Skills

Depending on your skills and experience, participation in this periodical activity may consist of

An important component in project design is information. Research helps develop projects more accurately in covering the community s needs while avoiding conflict among its members.
 Survey and interview design, fieldwork (requires fluent Spanish) Data analysis and report writing Participation in internal workshops to improve current projects 
Permaculture project maintenance

The NGO team is currently piloting basic permaculture techniques (water re-use, gardening) to reduce the organization s impact on the Lobitos environment. These techniques are implemented in the vicinity of the NGO house where interns are housed and require constant attention and maintenance.

Community labour

The NGO constantly spends time with the local community and actively participates in communal activities, such as assisting fishermen in docking their boats for maintenance or helping other local NGOs set up and execute public events. This engagement is crucial for your placement experience as it gives you the opportunity to share with community members in their everyday environment and learn from the other organizations with which the NGO works.

Logistics

The many activities that occur on a daily basis within the NGO headquarters (intern activities, project design +amp; implementation, marketing activities, etc.) can often be a little daunting to manage without proper logistics. As an NGO management intern, you will be able to support the organization by running errands that are necessary for the fluidity of the daily operations. Tasks may include: organizing documents, data entry, printing, errands in Talara City (buying equipment, food, etc), delivering messages, picking up packages, etc.

Marketing - traditional and digital

The NGO has rapidly been gaining exposure on a global scale and is continuously improving and evolving their marketing strategy to properly harness this growth both through traditional and digital platforms. You will be assisting the marketing and communications team in the planning and execution of a variety of tasks, both online and offline. The online tasks include: social media community managing and content creation (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Blogs, etc), website development (HTML, CSS, Javascript), online advertising, etc. The offline tasks include: Graphic design, event planning, press release writing, etc.
