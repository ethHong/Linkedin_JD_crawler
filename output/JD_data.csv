42dot Way

Only hire competent and self-motivated team players with humble leadership.

서로를 성장시킬 수 있고 자체 무한동력을 가진 누구에게나 배울 수 있는 겸손한 리더십을 가진 팀 플레이어를 채용하라.

Influence with trust, not with authority.

직급과 권한이 아닌 신뢰와 건강한 영향력을 토대로 업무하고 서로를 성장시켜라. 직책을 가졌다고 리더가 되는 것은 아니다. 여기는 직책에 관계없이 미션과 비전에 맞는 영향력을 행사할 수 있는 곳이다.

Deliver with agility rather than perfecting.

완벽보다 빠른 완성이다. 세상의 거대한 문제를 풀려고 하지 말아야 한다. 작게 시작해서 빠르게 지속적인 결과물을 내자. 그러면 생각보다 빠르게 큰 문제를 풀 수 있다. 그러기 위해서는 지독하게 스마트하게 일해야 한다. 여기는 연구하는 곳도 아니고 성실하게 열심히만 해서 되는 곳도 아니다. 가장 잘 되는 방법을 찾고 가장 빠르게 실행해야 한다. 대신 대충하지 마라. 결코 현재의 결과물에 만족하지 말아라.

Do the right thing.

회사의 미션(회사의 존재 이유)과 비전(목표)에 집중하고 시장에서의 성공적인 결과물에 집중해야 한다. 여기는 회사와 개인이 같은 이유와 목표를 가지고 성장하는 곳이다. 개인/조직끼리 협의나 타협보다 회사가 올바른 방향으로 나가기 위해 조직의 희생까지 감수할 수 있는 과감한 결정을 지속적으로 내려야 한다.

Disagree now, but align.

결정되기 전 자신의 의견을 충분히 내고 결정 후에는 공동의 목표에 align 하라.

Collaborate & communicate transparently beyond team boundaries.

투명하게 정보와 지식을 공유하고 팀이 없는 것처럼 협업하라. 협업의 시작은 투명한 정보 공유이다.

Be prepared to be totally transparent. A penny you spend, or even when you arrive or leave will be open to everyone.

사내의 많은 것들이 투명하게 공유된다. 투명함은 몰입에 방해되는 많은 요소들을 없애기 때문이다.

Be aware that all the benefits & perks are provided for faster execution & delivery.

회사의 모든 혜택들은 즐기라고 있는 것이 아니고 업무의 몰입을 극대화해서 빠르게 좋은 결과물을 내기 위해서이다.

Never stop learning! Never stop changing! Never stop dreaming!

The cryptocurrency market is one of the most vibrant financial markets full of opportunities.

Sandbank is seeking an exceptional individual to join the firm as a Quantitative Researcher. The person must have a strong understanding of the investment research process to create computer-based models that seek opportunities and take the most relevant actions when finding one.
