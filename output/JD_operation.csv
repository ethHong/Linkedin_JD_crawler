트릿지의 Product Design 팀은 B2B 거래 시장과 다양한 시장 정보 (market intelligence) 의 특성을 정확히 이해하고, 정교한 인터페이스 설계를 통해 보다 효과적인 무역 활동을 위한 최적의 고객 경험을 구현합니다. 새로운 디지털 영역에 대한 도전인만큼 다양한 시행 착오를 통한 제품 개선 과정이 필수적이며, 이에 lean한 UX 개발 프로세스를 위한 빠른 (fast) 동시에 유효한 (effective) 프로토타이핑 능력이 요구됩니다. UX 리서치, 인터랙션 디자인, 시각 디자인 등 다양한 영역의 디자인 스킬을 활용하면서, 제품 전략 브레인스토밍에서 pixel-perfect 디자인까지 모든 제품 개발 프로세스에 참여하게 됩니다.

이런 역할을 수행합니다:
